## Meeting Summary (Transcript 4)

**Purpose:** Discuss presentation format changes, ordering timeline, PCB readiness, subsystem milestones, waterproof rating clarification, and prototype deadlines.

---

### Key Points Discussed

#### 1) Presentation Update
- Originally planned as in-class presentations.
- Updated plan: **Recorded video submission** due to large class size (~40+ students).
- Expected length: **~5–10 minutes** (avoid exceeding ~15 minutes).
- Focus:
  - Include technical engineering content.
  - Demonstrate subsystem functionality.
  - Optionally include short demo or highlight clip (keep professional).

---

#### 2) Ordering Timeline & Logistics
- Goal: Submit parts order **next week**.
- Recommendation:
  - Consolidate parts onto as few vendors as possible.
  - Submit early due to:
    - Shipping delays
    - PCB lead time (1–3 weeks typical)
    - Possible customs/tariff delays
- Ordering goes through Julie — submit ASAP once finalized.

---

#### 3) PCB Status

- **Ryan’s PCB:** Completed.
- **Landen’s PCB:** Completed; minor DRC constraint concern but likely non-critical.
- **Andrew’s PCB:** Components selected; routing/tracing pending.
- Plan: Finish remaining PCB work next weekend.
- Boards expected to take ~2–3 weeks from JLCPCB.

---

#### 4) Subsystem & Prototype Deadlines

Expected timeline:
- **Mid-March (~March 17):** Minimal Functional Subsystem Prototype
- **Early April (~April 1):** Minimal Functional Full System Prototype
- **Late April (Dead Week):** Poster + Final Expo Presentation
- Finals week follows early May.

Minimal Functional Prototype:
- Must demonstrate subsystem meets defined specifications.
- May not require every spec — clarify with instructor.
- Some negotiation possible on % of requirements required.

Action:
- Confirm grading expectations (minimum specs vs full compliance).

---

#### 5) Software Progress

- Display baseline code written and tested previously.
- Only pending:
  - IMU integration
  - Final data push from microcontroller
- Bluetooth confirmed as communication method.
- Backend handles calculations if needed.

---

#### 6) Display Mounting Considerations

- Display distance from eye must be adjustable.
- Proposed solution:
  - Sliding arm with set screw
  - Adjustable bracket
- Final display mount will be printed last after boards arrive.

---

#### 7) Waterproof Rating Clarification

- Correct rating: **Basic dust/sweat resistance** (not submersible).
- IP rating adjusted (low water exposure rating).
- Device will **not** be marketed or tested as waterproof/submersible.

---

#### 8) Battery & Power Indicator

- System currently lacks battery indicator.
- Suggested:
  - Simple LED power indicator.
  - Optional low-voltage threshold indicator.
- Advanced battery percentage display considered unnecessary for now.

---

#### 9) Assembly & Lab Resources

- Soldering options available:
  - Capstone lab
  - Electronics lab (microscope, hot air reflow station)
- Surface-mount soldering feasible with hot air + flux.
- Isopropyl alcohol cleanup available.

---

### Risks Identified

- PCB shipping delays.
- Customs/tariff-related delays.
- Battery sizing affecting enclosure adjustments.
- Time compression between PCB arrival and prototype deadline.

---

### Action Items

- **Team:** Finalize PCB routing and submit order ASAP.
- **Landen:** Confirm DRC concern is non-critical.
- **Andrew/Ryan:** Complete PCB routing next weekend.
- **All:** Prepare recorded presentation.
- **Team:** Confirm minimal subsystem requirement expectations with instructor.
- **Power Team:** Consider adding basic power indicator LED.

---

### Overall Status

- Designs largely complete.
- Ordering phase imminent.
- Software progressing.
- Enclosure pending final hardware dimensions.
- Timeline manageable if ordering is submitted promptly.
