# Smart Golf Visor — Meeting Minutes (New Recording 15.m4a)

## Quick Summary
Team will **pivot away from Garmin/closed-API** approach due to approvals risk and timeline uncertainty, and **adopt an open-source launch monitor** as the project’s primary sensing subsystem. Emphasis shifts to getting a **working prototype by early April** (Capstone 2 milestone), with clear ownership of the launch monitor build, stronger **power budgeting**, and **document refinements** (trade studies, standards, figures).

## Key Decisions
1. **Drop Garmin/closed access path.** Paperwork + approvals timeline is prohibitive and uncertain; risk of non-approval is high.  
2. **Adopt open-source launch monitor.**  
   - Use available **software, 3D print files, parts list, and budget** from the chosen repo.  
   - **Verify and, if needed, improve** any circuits/regulators and mechanicals for our use case (outdoor, portable).  
3. **Make Launch Monitor its own subsystem (possibly two):**  
   - **Enclosure/mechanics** and **electronics/firmware/power/comms** can be separated if resourcing requires.  
   - Assign a clear **owner** responsible for assembly, verification, and integration (Bryce was suggested/volunteered in discussion).  
4. **Power System scope:** Power subsystem covers **visor AND launch monitor** (two physical devices, one conceptual power subsystem).  
5. **Prototype priority:** **Working launch-monitor prototype first**, then visor/HUD/cloud features.

## Requirements & Guidance Captured

### Power & Energy
- Design around **1S Li-ion/LiPo** with **parallel cells (e.g., 1S-xP)** for capacity/current; explicitly justify the choice.  
- Provide **runtime targets**: minimum 9 holes, max 18; **overshoot** the time assumption for safety.  
- Compute **Wh** from estimated loads (include **converter efficiencies** and **ripple** considerations).  
- Consider **~6000 mAh** battery as a healthy cushion (contextual suggestion).  
- Launch monitor may need its **own pack** (or dedicated rail) depending on draw.  
- Consider **ancillary solar** to trickle-backcharge when deployed outdoors (optional, budget-dependent).

### Open-Source Monitor Adaptation
- Treat repo as a **baseline**, not a black box:  
  - **Analyze regulators** (efficiency, ripple), thermal, enclosure, weather resistance.  
  - Modify AC/wall-powered designs to **portable battery** architecture for field use.  
  - Use **PETG/ABS** or other weather-resistant materials for printed parts; check Makerspace filament options.

### Documentation Improvements
- **Trade studies:** Unify format; add **semi-trade study** for multiple open-source options to justify the chosen base.  
- **Standards:** When citing IEEE/FCC/battery/safety standards, include **specific numeric limits** (freq bands, TX power, temp limits, Wh, etc.) and **map each** to the subsystem where it applies.  
- **Block diagrams & flowcharts:**  
  - Hardware diagram is strong; address small edits.  
  - Rework **gray “comms” diagrams** to add missing info.  
  - Over-define connections now; we can prune later.  
- **Figures & tables:** Avoid gray-on-black; prefer **high-contrast**. Clean snips (no stray Excel highlights/cursors).  
- **Language:** Be **assertive**—use **min–max** specs; avoid “it would be nice.”  
- **Comparative analysis:** Make this section robust; it **drives** subsystem choices.

### Fabrication & Testing
- **3D printing:** Use **Makerspace**; flag **Capstone priority**; consider budgeting **filament** (and material choice) if needed.  
- **Testing:** Plan for **many trials** and **large sample sizes** in Capstone 2. Recruit **testers** early. Capture video/data.

---

## Milestones & Dates
- **“The 3rd” due date (per transcript):** document submission checkpoint. *(Likely Nov 3; confirm internally.)*  
- **Early April (Capstone 2):** **Minimal working prototype due** (must pass this for schedule health).  
- **Finals:** Capstone **report** + **expo** dependent on earlier prototype completion and testing runway.

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Open-source design underperforms in outdoor use.  
  - *Mitigation:* Early verification of sensors, power rails, and enclosure; weather-resistant materials; field tests.  
- **Risk:** Power shortfall and runtime misses.  
  - *Mitigation:* Conservative Wh estimates, 1S-xP capacity cushion, solar trickle optional, separate packs if needed.  
- **Risk:** Schedule slip on printing/assembly.  
  - *Mitigation:* Submit prints **early**, parallelize (enclosure vs. electronics), assign clear owners.

## Open Questions
- Confirm **exact due date** for the “3rd” (month/day).  
- Finalize **who** owns Launch Monitor (and whether to split into two sub-owners).  
- Confirm **Makerspace filament** options (PETG/ABS) and any budget for filament.  
- Decide on **solar backcharge** feature (nice-to-have vs. in-scope).

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. Lock the **open-source baseline** and update all diagrams.  
2. Produce a **first-pass power budget** with Wh and 1S-xP justification.  
3. Refactor **trade studies** and **standards** sections with concrete numbers and mappings.  
4. Assign **owners** and kick off **printing** and **monitor assembly**.  
5. Submit the **cleaned draft** for advisor review **before the 3rd**.
