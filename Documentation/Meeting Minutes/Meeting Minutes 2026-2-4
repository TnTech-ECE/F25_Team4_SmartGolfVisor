## Meeting Summary (Transcript 2)

**Purpose:** Coordinate upcoming **individual presentations** before parts ordering, confirm timelines, and share status on software prototype + logistics (JC meeting, ordering sheet).

---

### Key Points Discussed

#### 1) Presentations scheduling (priority)
- Presentations are **individual**, but likely scheduled **as a group on the same day**.
- Plan: **Email Storm on Monday** to lock in presentation dates.
- Concern: if the next available Monday is **the 23rd**, that’s tight because **ordering is due on the 27th** (shipping lead time risk).
- Alternative: use **office hours / weekday slot** to avoid pushing too late.
- Storm wants presentations completed **before ordering anything**.

#### 2) Ordering format + parts list
- Storm has an uploaded **ordering/template** (the one shown in class).
- Note: **JLCPCB ordering** is different from general parts ordering (separate flow for PCB assembly/components).
- Landen will **email the Excel ordering sheet** to the team so everyone can paste in their own links/items.

#### 3) Software progress (backend prototype)
- A **prototype backend** is working locally:
  - Runs **Python locally** (not cloud/web-hosted yet).
  - Takes shot data → validates it → sends to another program → outputs to **CSV** in the desired structured format.
- Front-end and communications are **not done yet**.
- Comms coordination with Ryan will happen **later in the month** (tentative).

#### 4) Upcoming JC meeting
- Team meeting with **JC Friday at 10:00 AM** (same room).
- Request: **Everyone except Andrew and Ryan** attend (noted they likely can’t).
- Purpose: give JC a **status update** (“where we’re at” / same as last update).

#### 5) Landen PCB + battery discussion
- Landen plans to ask **Tyler** about PCB clearance/DRC concerns (send a screenshot; expectation: may not matter).
- Battery size may be reduced (example: **4000 mAh → 3000 mAh**) to improve fit; circuit remains **3.7 V LiPo** (voltage must stay the same).
- Discussion acknowledged some batteries can be “suspect” / hard to source reliably, but swapping capacity is low risk since it’s plug-in.

#### 6) Water resistance / IP rating clarification (risk/expectations)
- Confusion/joking around the idea of **submerging** vs **spray resistance**.
- Takeaway: be realistic—don’t claim unrealistic underwater testing; focus on practical precautions and whatever protection level is actually designed.

### Action Items
- **Landen:** Email Storm on Monday to schedule presentations; share the Excel ordering sheet with the team.
- **Team:** Start filling in ordering sheet (links + quantities) ASAP.
- **Software lead:** Continue moving from local prototype to cloud/web-hosted + add comms + front end; sync with Ryan later this month.
- **Friday:** Attend JC meeting at **10:00 AM** for progress update (except Andrew/Ryan as discussed).
- **Landen:** Ask Tyler about PCB errors/clearances; decide if any footprint/board-size changes are needed.
