## Meeting Summary (Transcript 3)

**Purpose:** Clarify data handling (storage vs overwrite), Bluetooth packet limits, available PiTrak metrics, PCB/battery sizing updates, and presentation submission logistics.

---

### Key Points Discussed

#### 1) Data Storage vs Overwrite (Backend + Visor)
- Decision: **No long-term storage** of shot data.
- Data will be **overwritten each shot** after display.
- No “history” or “go back” functionality planned in the app.
- This simplifies backend and visor logic.
- Storing data would only be necessary if implementing logs or shot review — not currently required.

---

#### 2) Dynamic Data Fields / Dropdown Customization (Deferred)
- Idea discussed: customizable dropdown menus selecting which metrics to send/display.
- Would require:
  - Fully dynamic code
  - Byte-index handling
  - Runtime packet restructuring
- Decision: **Not necessary given limited metrics available.**
- System will send a fixed structure instead.

---

#### 3) Bluetooth Packet Size Clarification
- ESP32 BLE max transmission size discussed:
  - Up to **247 bytes per BLE packet**
  - Recommended smaller size (~20–25 bytes) for stability in some cases
- Conclusion: Plenty of packet headroom for the small metric set.
- No concerns about exceeding BLE limits.

---

#### 4) PiTrak Available Metrics (Important Limitation)

Metrics confirmed available:
- Ball Speed
- Launch Angle
- Side Angle
- Back Spin
- Side Spin
- (Possibly Smash Factor — needs confirmation)

Not directly available:
- Club Head Speed
- Distance (must be calculated)
- Additional derived metrics

Implication:
- Distance likely must be calculated using:
  - Ball speed
  - Launch angle
  - Spin
- If additional metrics are needed, calculations can be handled:
  - In backend API
  - Not on visor itself

Decision:
- Keep metric set simple and realistic.
- If questioned during presentation: explain hardware limitations and budget constraints.

---

#### 5) Presentations Update
- Storm email clarified:
  - Presentation will be **recorded video upload**
  - Not live in-class presentation
- No additional scheduling required.
- Continue preparing presentation materials.

---

#### 6) PCB & Battery Sizing Update
- Landen researching smaller LiPo:
  - Target: **3000 mAh**
  - Desired dimensions approx: ~60mm x 40mm range
- Voltage remains **3.7V (non-negotiable)**.
- Enclosure redesign depends on finalized battery dimensions.
- Avoid redesigning enclosure multiple times before PCB order is finalized.

---

#### 7) Git / Submission Logistics
- For Detailed Design submission:
  - Use permanent link (main branch or approved pull request).
  - Ensure updated document link is submitted.
- Bluetooth confirmed as communication method (no change).

---

### Action Items

- **Backend Lead:** Continue API development; handle derived metric calculations if needed.
- **Landen:** Finalize smaller battery option; update enclosure once dimensions confirmed.
- **Team:** Prepare recorded presentation for submission.
- **All:** Confirm final metric list before coding final display layout.

---

### Risks Identified

- Overestimating available PiTrak metrics.
- Battery size affecting enclosure redesign.
- BLE stability if packet size increases unnecessarily.
- Last-minute metric changes requiring code restructuring.

---

### Overall Status

- Communication method confirmed (BLE).
- Data handling simplified (no storage).
- Metric list mostly confirmed.
- Presentation format clarified.
- Hardware progressing; battery sizing still under refinement.
