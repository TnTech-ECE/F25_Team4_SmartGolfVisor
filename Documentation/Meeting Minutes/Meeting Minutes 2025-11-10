## 1) Project Document Formatting & Submission
- Keep the **exact subsection headers** provided (Function, Subsystem Specs, Constraints, Overview, Interface).
- Share a **finished, formatted example** if you complete early so everyone matches the layout.
- **Submission cadence:** once per week to professor; **send drafts anytime** to the advisor for feedback.
- Expect **strict early feedback** to align with professor’s standards.

---

## 2) Software Tools & 3D Modeling
- Use **Fusion 360** (free via TTU student license). **Autodesk Inventor** is also available.
- Fusion supports **STL/OBJ**, assemblies, animations, and **scripting**.
- You can **import and edit existing CAD** (e.g., launch monitor models). Confirm reuse with professor.

---

## 3) PCB & Electrical Design Guidance
- **Power subsystem** will be closely reviewed.
- For RF/comm lines (ESP32, etc.), route at **50 Ω** (use impedance calculators).
- Size **trace widths** for maximum current per IPC/EDA rules.
- Add a **power distribution board** with **fuse close to the battery**.
- Fuse options: inline holders or small modular **fuse boxes**.
- LiPo noted as lower risk than Li-ion, but **protection still required**.

---

## 4) Hardware Assembly & Build Practices
- **No breadboards** in the final build (okay for quick fixes only).
- Use **proto-boards** with copper strips for repairs if needed.
- Provide **dedicated PCBs** per subsystem (ESP32 logic, power distribution, etc.).
- Design **protective, water-resistant** enclosures; consider **thermal separation** for battery/microcontroller.

---

## 5) Detailed Design Expectations
- Docs must allow a new student (e.g., **Connor**) to build without questions.
- Include:
  - Updated **schematics** with final voltages, interfaces, protocols.
  - **Flowcharts**, **pseudo code**, and **block diagrams** for software.
- Aim for a **build-ready** package entering Capstone II.

---

## 6) Software (App Subsystem) Notes
- Provide **flowcharts, pseudo code, and detailed commentary** (full code optional now).
- Clearly document **data flow** and **interfaces** between subsystems.
- Ensure feasibility by March; reduce coding load in Capstone II with strong groundwork now.

---

## 7) Prototype Timeline
- **Detailed Design target:** ~**Dec 3**.  
- **Order parts:** Winter break (arrive early January).  
- **Build & test:** Jan–Mar; **Experimental validation:** Mar–Apr.  
- **Passing criterion:** demonstrate a **working prototype**.

---

## 8) Launch Monitor Power Discussion
- GitHub PiTrack appears **wall-powered** → must be **battery-powered**.
- Rough estimate: **2 cameras × 0.5 A = ~1 A**; for **4 hours** ⇒ **~6–7 Ah**.
- Options: **Li-ion/LiPo packs**, **power-tool batteries** with BMS; optional **solar backup**.
- **Visor** needs small pack (~**3 Ah**); **launch monitor** likely separate, larger pack.

## 9) Action Items
| Task | Owner(s) | Due |
|---|---|---|
| Align headers/format across all subsystem reports | All | Before submission |
| Start Fusion 360 enclosure models | Mechanical lead | Ongoing |
| Calculate 50 Ω lines + power trace widths | Power team | Next meeting |
| Draft pseudo code & flowcharts (App) | App team | By ~Dec 3 |
| Verify battery sizing & fusing plan | Power team | By ~Dec 3 |
| Prepare advisor review draft | All | By ~Dec 3 |
| Plan BOM & place orders | Subsystem leads | Winter break |

---

## 10) Closing Notes
- Prioritize **clarity, documentation, and safety**.
- Design so others can **assemble without guidance**.
- Invest now to **save time** during build/debug in Capstone II.
