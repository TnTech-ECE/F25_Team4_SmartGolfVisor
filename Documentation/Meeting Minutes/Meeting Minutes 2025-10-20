## Discussion Topics

### 1. Launch Monitor Options
- Garmin was discussed as the primary candidate.
- Concern raised over many launch monitors being private, subscription-based, or not Android compatible.
- Several monitors found only worked indoors and weren’t portable.
- A DIY build-your-own option was mentioned (e.g., GIY project), but noted it would require significant subsystem effort.

### 2. Data Access & Integration
- Aim is to collect metrics (spin rate, ball speed, etc.) and export them from a launch monitor.
- GS Pro was discussed as a potential API/simulation software platform; it is open source.
- Discussion around Garmin’s app allowing data export to platforms like Google Drive or OneDrive, but export must be done manually after each session, not per shot.
- The need for an app to automate session handling and data relay was emphasized.

### 3. Device Compatibility
- SC4 Pro was reviewed; may include desired metrics (spin axis, side spin), but uncertainty remains about its app/API access.
- Some models have on-screen data but no app communication, complicating integration.
- USB data access was suggested but not confirmed.

### 4. App vs Web App Architecture
- Discussion on whether to build a native Android app vs a web-based app.
- Web app would rely on cloud infrastructure and persistent internet connection; may increase latency and power consumption.
- Native Android app would simplify Bluetooth communication and data handling locally.

### 5. Project Hardware and Budget Adjustments
- Decision to consolidate to one microcontroller instead of one per module to reduce cost by ~$150.
- Current budget standing at around $1,050.

### 6. Technical Planning
- Block diagram planning started, team agreed to collaborate to avoid errors.
- Discussion on how to represent subsystems such as power and communication in the diagram.

### 7. API Understanding
- Clarification provided: API serves as a communication protocol between devices and software.
- Uncertainty expressed around how to access and utilize device APIs on Android.

### 8. Next Steps & Meetings
- Next meeting scheduled with JC for design review and approval.
- JC approval is required before submission to the stakeholder or store.
- Noted that one additional week was granted for the submission.

## Action Items
- Further research Garmin SC4 Pro’s app and potential for API or data extraction.
- Begin development or prototyping of Android or web app for data relay.
- Finalize and clean up the block diagram collaboratively.
- Prepare for JC design approval review before final submission.
