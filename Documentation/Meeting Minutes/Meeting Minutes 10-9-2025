Smart Golf Visor — Conceptual Design Working Session (Meeting Minutes)
1. Meeting Meta


Near-term deadlines:

Conceptual Design submission: Monday, October 27, 2025

Detailed Design: late November 2025 (target week of Nov 24, 2025; confirm with instructor)

Note: Some sign-offs may extend into Capstone II (confirm process with instructor)

2. Purpose

Align on Conceptual Design expectations for the 10/27/2025 submission.

Identify critical dependencies (launch-monitor API access) and documentation standards.

Establish next steps toward Detailed Design (late November).

3. Key Decisions & Guidance

Subsystems

Keep HUD Display and App as distinct subsystems.

Clearly define interfaces and responsibilities for each block.

Block Diagrams

Top-level: One block per subsystem; every connection must have a labeled input and output.

Atomic (per subsystem): Drill down to bands and protocols (e.g., “Bluetooth 2.4 GHz” → “BLE” → “GATT characteristics”; “Wi-Fi 5 GHz” → “802.11ac”; I²C/SPI/UART; MCU pins where known).

Operational User Flow

App launch → device discovery/sync → user settings → shot captured → monitor computes metrics → HUD renders → data stored → coaching suggestions generated.

Power & Protection

Battery: target LiPo ~3000 mAh for ≈ 6 hours runtime (≥ 18 holes).

Topology: e.g., 2S1P (state explicitly) and select a matching 2S BMS with balance leads for each series node.

Rails: provision 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V; document buck/boost regulation paths to each load.

Protection: inline fusing 0.5–1.0 A per vendor guidance; include reverse-polarity/ESD where sensible.

Standards & Safety

Device is face-worn; research and cite safety/EMC and relevant AR/NEC guidance.

Prefer LiPo (lower energy density vs cylindrical Li-ion) with justification.

Budget

Begin listing candidate parts (battery, BMS, MCU/SoC, display/optics, radios) with unit prices; if undecided, use averages and conservative totals.

Application Approach

Primary: Android app.

Alternative: local web app (HTML/ESP32-hosted) for rapid control/UX; ensure a clean, minimal UI.

Shall Statements

Restate previous shalls; analyze ≥ 3 solution approaches (including chosen path).

Justify selection (cost, latency, integration risk, schedule).

Last window to revise shalls based on API reality.

Sign-off Reality

Some sign-offs may slide to Capstone II; seek explicit instructor guidance.

4. Risks, Dependencies, Mitigations

R1 — Launch-monitor API access (critical path)

Risk: Approval delay; limited fields; proprietary formats.

Mitigation: Weekly vendor contact (every 7 days) via sales + engineering; ask for (a) exact metrics exposed (e.g., ball speed, spin rate, launch angle) and (b) data formats/schemas. If access is blocked, pivot to an open-API device.

R2 — Workload imbalance

Risk: Comms/API may exceed other tracks.

Mitigation: Designate a floater/backup engineer in the doc.

R3 — Analytics validation

Risk: Insufficient math basis for coaching/trajectory.

Mitigation: Use projectile/ballistics modeling (differential equations) to estimate flight/landing from measured metrics.

5. Required Artifacts for the 10/27/2025 Submission

Introduction (graded heavily).

Restated shall statements with multi-option analysis (≥ 3).

Top-level block diagram with all I/O labeled.

Atomic subsystem diagrams (protocols, bands, MCU pins, power rails).

User-flow operational chart (end-to-end).

Standards & safety section (face-worn device, protection).

Preliminary budget (candidate parts + current prices; conservative totals).

6. Action Items (numbered, owner, deadline)

Call the launch-monitor vendor to confirm metrics and data formats; continue weekly until approval.

Owner: Bryce (Visor/API) + Comms team

Start: 10/14/2025

Cadence: Every 7 days until approved

Draft the top-level block diagram (all subsystems; labeled I/O).

Owner: Subsystem leads

Due: 10/20/2025

Create atomic subsystem diagrams (2.4/5 GHz, BLE/Wi-Fi protocol, I²C/SPI/UART, MCU pins where known).

Owner: Each subsystem owner

Due: 10/23/2025

Define power architecture (rails 12 V/5 V/3.3 V, buck/boost paths, topology e.g., 2S1P, BMS selection, fuses 0.5–1.0 A).

Owner: Landen (Power/BMS)

Due: 10/23/2025

Standards & safety scan for face-worn electronics; document applicable guidance.

Owner: Power + Visor + App

Due: 10/24/2025

Build user-flow chart (app ↔ monitor ↔ glasses; settings/capture/display/storage/coaching).

Owner: App + HUD (Brandon)

Due: 10/24/2025

Identify candidate parts and prices; update the budget (include links/notes).

Owner: All subsystem owners

Due: 10/25/2025

Re-validate shall statements based on API realities; propose edits if needed.

Owner: Entire team

Due: 10/25/2025

Assign a floater/backup to the heaviest subsystem (likely Comms/API).

Owner: Team lead

Due: 10/18/2025

Begin ballistics/trajectory reference search (Google Scholar/IEEE Xplore).

Owner: HUD/Analytics (Brandon + support)

Due: 10/21/2025

Decide app path (Android vs local web app) and produce a wireframe.

Owner: App team

Due: 10/22/2025

Standardize diagramming tool (Visio or draw.io/Lucid); set a style guide (fonts, arrowheads, labels).

Owner: Teamwide

Due: 10/16/2025

7. Parking Lot / Open Questions

What is the API approval timeline and who is the vendor point of contact?

Which metrics are guaranteed vs derived (from available fields)?

What is the final display/optics path (to be locked during Detailed Design)?

Are there institutional/departmental standards specific to face-worn devices that must be cited?

8. Next Milestones

Conceptual Design due 10/27/2025.

Detailed Design target late November 2025 (week of Nov 24; confirm).

Expectation that some sign-offs may move to Capstone II (confirm).

9. Notes & Reminders

Over-define now, trim later.

Top-level diagram should be presentation-ready; atomic diagrams should be build-ready.

Even a minimal UI should look clean and intentional; polish pays off during reviews.
