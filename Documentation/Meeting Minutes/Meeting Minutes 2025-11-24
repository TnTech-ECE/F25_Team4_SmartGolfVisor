# MEETING NOTES – TRANSCRIPT 1 (New Recording 20)

**Topic:** Capstone Project Progress Update  
**Attendees:** Project team + industry mentor  
**Date:** Not specified  

---

## 1. Project Status Overview
- Team has completed the **Conceptual Design** phase.
- Currently working on the **Detailed Design**, focusing on subsystem responsibilities and how everything will integrate.

---

## 2. Subsystem Updates

### 2.1 Launch Monitor (Andrew)
- Building a **battery-powered launch monitor** for on-course golf use.
- Originally considered commercial launch monitors (e.g., Garmin), but:
  - These restrict access to raw calculated data.
- Team found an **open-source project** design that:
  - Allows direct access to calculated data.
  - Can be adapted to send data to their own app and visor system.
- Mentor provided a **consumer launch monitor** that:
  - Can later be used to **validate** accuracy of the team’s device.
- Parts cannot be ordered until **next semester**:
  - Current focus is on design, documentation, and planning.

### 2.2 Mobile App (Michael)
- Responsibilities:
  - Receive data from the launch monitor.
  - Display **previous rounds** and **sessions**.
  - Show **swing/shot metrics**.
  - Deliver **coaching tips** based on data (with mentor assistance).
- Data flow:
  - Launch monitor → App → Back to visor for in-play feedback.

### 2.3 Visor Hardware & Power
- **Bryce**:
  - Designing the **visor model** (mechanical/structural design).
- **Landen**:
  - Designing the **power subsystem** for the visor.
  - Current design target: **~9 hours** of battery life.
- Launch monitor is planned to have **similar runtime** so one device does not die significantly earlier than the other.
- **Ryan**:
  - Designing the **processor subsystem** that:
    - Processes incoming data.
    - Sends formatted output to the visor display.
- **Display**:
  - Data is shown through a see-through/visor-mounted display.
  - Due to limited display space, metrics will likely be shown **one at a time** with a timed rotation.

---

## 3. Selected Data Metrics for Display
Initial set of metrics chosen (can be expanded later):

1. **Ball Speed**  
2. **Spin Rate**  
3. **Distance**  
4. **Launch Angle**  
5. **Smash Factor**

- These are considered the most important core metrics for players.
- Display strategy:
  - Likely cycle one metric at a time with a timer.
  - App interface will provide more comprehensive views.

---

## 4. Coaching Suggestions Logic

- Mentor emphasized that **coaching suggestions** should not be based on a single shot.
- Better approach:
  - Use **patterns or repeated errors** (e.g., consistently high spin, pushed shots, etc.).
- For an issue like **excessive spin**, system could:
  - Offer **multiple possible causes**, such as:
    1. Alignment (aiming left/right of target).
    2. Attack angle (derived using smash factor).
    3. Swing path/swing mechanics.
- Recommendation:
  - Provide **2–3 coaching options** for the user to check, instead of a single “one cause” diagnosis.
- Implementation:
  - App has enough space to show detailed suggestions.
  - Visor display will show only key/high-level info because of limited screen real estate.

---

## 5. Data Validation & External Devices

- Mentor provided:
  - A comparatively **inexpensive launch monitor** device.
  - A **swing speed training device** that measures swing speed only.
- Intended uses:
  - Future **verification and comparison** of the team’s launch monitor data.
  - Not needed immediately; more relevant **next semester** when hardware is available.

---

## 6. Timeline & Next Steps

- **Remaining part of this semester:**
  - Focus on **Detailed Design documentation**:
    - Subsystem descriptions.
    - Data flow.
    - Power budgeting.
    - Coaching logic framework.
- **Next semester:**
  - Order components (launch monitor, visor electronics, power hardware).
  - Assemble and integrate subsystems.
  - Begin **testing and validation**.
- Mentor made clear:
  - Students can email for follow-up questions or deeper coaching logic discussions.

---

## 7. Additional Notes

- Another student group is working on a **GolfNow-powered website redesign** for the same facility.
  - Their work is more focused on **website cleanup and functionality** (e.g., member tee-time booking online).
- Mentor noted:
  - The visor/launch-monitor project is **more technically complex** and more “out-of-the-box” than the website project.

# MEETING NOTES – TRANSCRIPT 2 (New Recording 21)

**Topic:** PCB Design, Hardware Integration, and Documentation Requirements  
**Attendees:** Team + mentor  
**Date:** Not specified  

---

## 1. Recommended Resources

- **Phil’s Lab (YouTube)**:
  - Good for PCB design fundamentals and practical tips.
- **Cadence PCB Design Articles**:
  - How to choose PCB **stackup**.
  - How to size **trace widths**.
  - How to handle **high-speed signals** and **matched trace lengths** (e.g., USB, digital interfaces).

---

## 2. PCB Consistency and Fasteners

- All team members designing PCBs should:
  - Use **consistent screw types** (e.g., M2 screws).
  - Use compatible **mounting hole sizes**.
- Goal:
  - Avoid mismatched hardware such as some boards using M2 and others using M3.
  - Simplify mechanical integration and ordering.

---

## 3. Mechanical Mounting & 3D Printing

- Options for mounting plates and standoffs:
  - Use the **machine shop** (drill press, manual tapping) where available.
  - Or **3D print standoffs and plates** as one combined piece.
- In CAD (e.g., Fusion 360):
  - Threads can be modeled by:
    - Making a cylinder.
    - Creating a hole (negative extrude).
    - Applying the **thread feature** with the correct standard (e.g., M2).
- For the **CAD model** in this semester:
  - Main priority is showing reasonable mounting and standoff locations.
  - Exact thread details can be refined later.

---

## 4. Launch Monitor – PCB vs. Wiring

- For the **launch monitor**, a dedicated PCB **may not be required** if:
  - A **Raspberry Pi hat** or similar board is used.
  - Connections are **soldered**, not just jumper wires.
- Concerns with loose jumper wires:
  - Risk of disconnection with vibration or movement.
  - Harder for future teams to use the design reliably.
- Design report justification:
  - If no PCB is used, clearly state:
    - Wire gauge (AWG).
    - Ratings.
    - Connection method (soldered to hat/terminal).
    - Mechanical strain relief.

---

## 5. When a PCB Is Required

- For the **visor headset electronics**, a PCB **is strongly recommended**:
  - ESP32 with multiple discrete wires hanging off is undesirable.
  - A dedicated PCB allows:
    - Clean layout.
    - Secure connectors.
    - Integrated filters (LC filters) for power rails.
- Advisor expects visor electronics to be on a **dedicated PCB** inside the visor housing.

---

## 6. Standardizing PCB Size

- Recommendation:
  - Team should agree on a **standard PCB footprint** (e.g., 8 cm × 6 cm or 12 cm × 5 cm) for all subsystem boards where practical.
- Suggested steps:
  1. Identify mechanical constraints (e.g., maximum PCB size that fits inside visor sleeve/housing).
  2. Set a **maximum board size** that fits those constraints.
  3. Use that same size (or a consistent set of dimensions) across your subsystem PCBs for easier CAD and documentation.
- The largest components such as **ESP32** and **power converters** will guide the minimum board area required.

---

## 7. Power Subsystem & Converter Design

- Battery:
  - Battery pack includes a built-in **BMS** in a plastic pouch on top of the cell.
  - BMS handles basic **protection and balancing**.
- Existing board:
  - Has a built-in converter that can output **3.3 V at ~240 mA**, which is insufficient.
- New approach:
  - Use a **Texas Instruments buck-boost converter** capable of **3.3 V at 800 mA**.
  - This meets power requirements for ESP32, display, and IMU.
- Charging:
  - Since BMS exists, the battery can be charged with regulated voltage.
  - For the report, include a **shall statement** for **CC–CV charging** (constant-current/constant-voltage).
- TI tools:
  - TI provides an online **design tool** that:
    - Helps choose inductors, capacitors, and layout.
    - Often comes with a **PSpice/Spice model** for simulation.
- Simulation expectations:
  - Run **SPICE simulations** (LTspice or similar) for:
    - Output ripple.
    - Efficiency vs. load.
    - Transient behavior.

---

## 8. Grounding & KiCad Details

- Different ground symbols:
  - **Chassis ground**, **earth ground**, and **signal ground** appear in reference schematics.
- In KiCad:
  - You mainly need a consistent **GND net** unless you are intentionally isolating parts of the circuit.
- For isolated sections:
  - Use separate ground nets and keep them unconnected in the schematic where isolation is required (e.g., isolated DC/DC output).

---

## 9. Filtering (LC Circuit) and Analysis

- For LC filters:
  - Use the standard cutoff formula:  
    \[
    f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
    \]
  - Explain **why** chosen L and C values filter switching ripple at the converter’s switching frequency.
- Advisor expects:
  - Clear reasoning tying datasheet values and your calculations.
  - A short explanation or figure showing frequency response or ripple suppression.

---

## 10. Protection Elements

- Suggestions:
  - **Fuse** in series with the battery.
  - **TVS diode** across supply rails for surge protection.
  - **Reverse-polarity protection**:
    - MOSFET-based solution is preferred over a simple diode to reduce voltage drop.
- Include small SPICE or conceptual plots/figures to show:
  - Why a MOSFET-based reverse protection works (requires gate threshold before conduction).
  - How the fuse/TVS protects against faults.

---

## 11. Flowcharts & Documentation Style

- When describing:
  - Data transmission.
  - Power flow.
  - Control logic.
- Use **flowcharts** instead of long paragraphs:
  - Example: “Using SPI to transmit data from sensor to ESP32 to app” → Show as a block-flow diagram.
- Written explanation + flowchart is ideal.

---

## 12. PCB Cost Estimation & BOM

- PCB pricing:
  - Use **JLCPCB** (or similar) to obtain cost estimates.
  - Steps:
    1. Download a sample PCB Gerber (similar size to your design) from GitHub.
    2. Upload it to JLCPCB.
    3. Choose **FR4**, standard thickness, and basic options.
    4. Use estimated cost (without assuming discounts).
- BOM notes:
  - Each subsystem owner creates their own **Bill of Materials**.
  - KiCad can export a BOM, but might require:
    - Mapping parts to Mouser/DigiKey.
    - Cleaning up part names and references.
  - It may be easier to build a BOM manually using a spreadsheet.

---

## 13. Parts Selection & Redundancy

- When ordering:
  - Order **extra components** (resistors, capacitors, inductors, connectors) to account for failures and rework.
  - Expensive items (e.g., Raspberry Pis) should be ordered in the **minimum** quantity needed.
- For Raspberry Pi:
  - Design uses **Pi 4B**.
  - In the report:
    - Explain why Pi 4B is chosen over Pi 5 (e.g., cost savings, performance sufficient, availability).

---

## 14. Consistency Across Subsystems

- If one team member has already done a calculation or justification (e.g., trace width for a battery rail):
  - Others may **reuse** that reasoning where applicable, keeping the documentation consistent.
- Always:
  - Stay consistent with naming (same net names, same units).
  - Use the same engineering assumptions across the whole project.

---

## 15. Scheduling and Draft Review

- Mentor is willing to:
  - Review draft reports submitted around **Tuesday**, likely able to respond by **Wednesday**.
- Expectation:
  - Have a reasonably complete draft ready for feedback before final submission.
