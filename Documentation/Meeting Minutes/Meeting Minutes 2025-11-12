# Smart Golf Visor — Capstone Team Meeting Minutes  
**Recording:** Tennessee Tech University 7.m4a  
**Date:** 11-12-2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  

**Attendees:**
- Landen Johnson  
- Bryce Hughes  
- Brandon Zerkovich  
- Ryan Zerkovich  
- Michael Madigan  
- [Others as applicable]

## 1. General Announcements
- **Advisor meeting with Matt** scheduled for **Tuesday at 1:30 PM**.  
  - Purpose: Keep advisor updated on progress and confirm design directions.  
  - Expected duration: ~15 minutes.  
- **DigiKey** confirmed as an **approved vendor** for component purchases.

---

## 2. Coaching Feature Discussion
- Current **shall statement**: system provides **coaching suggestions** based on performance.
- Concern: Advisor will likely say **single-shot advice** is not very accurate.
- Team discussed options:
  - Move from **per-shot** advice to:
    - **Per hole**, **per nine holes**, or **per round** advice.
  - Single-shot messages can still be **short and simple** (e.g., “Square the clubface,” “Face open,” “Low spin”).
- Data usage:
  - Use metrics such as **spin**, **launch angle**, and **ball flight**.
  - More reliable advice generated after multiple swings rather than a single measurement.

**Action Item:**  
- Clarify with Matt whether coaching suggestions should be:
  - Per-shot (simple/low-accuracy), or  
  - Aggregated over **multiple swings/holes/rounds**.

---

## 3. Display & User Interface
- Goal: Show **shot metrics** and **coaching suggestions** on the visor display.
- Constraints:
  - Limited display size may restrict text length.
  - Too many metrics will clutter the screen and reduce readability.
- Options discussed:
  - Use **short phrases** for advice (few words only).
  - Consider **scrolling text / ticker** area for longer suggestions.
  - Carefully choose **font size** and **layout** for readability.
- **Graphics library:**  
  - Plan to use **LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) for the embedded GUI.
  - Will prototype different layouts and test what’s readable in practice.

**Action Items:**
- Landen:
  - Evaluate display options for:
    - Resolution, brightness, contrast ratio.
    - Ability to fit both **metrics** and **short suggestions**.
  - Prototype a basic LVGL layout once hardware is selected.

## 4. Hardware Integration & Power Design
- **Main microcontroller:** ESP32-P4 (development board).
- **Power strategy:**
  - LiPo battery voltage range: ~4.2 V (full) down to ~2.75–3.0 V (cutoff).
  - ESP32 dev board typically expects **5 V input** and uses an onboard **buck (DC–DC) converter** or LDO to drop to **3.3 V**.
- Discussion points:
  - Option 1: Use a **boost or buck-boost converter** to provide **stable 5 V** to the dev board, then let onboard regulator step down to 3.3 V.
  - Option 2: Directly supply **3.3 V** if pinout supports it (via VSYS or 3.3 V rail), accepting some inefficiency due to internal conversion.
  - Onboard regulator will continue to output 3.3 V even if input is 3.3 V, with slightly higher power loss.
- **Display power:**
  - Selected OLED option can accept **3.3 V or 5 V** (includes a level shifter).
  - Expected current draw is low (~a few mA), negligible compared to ESP32.
- **Grounding:**
  - All subsystems must share a **common ground** referenced to the **battery negative terminal**.

**Action Items:**
- Brandon:
  - Decide between **5 V rail** (with boost) vs **direct 3.3 V** distribution approach.
  - Finalize **converter selection** (efficiency target ≥ 90%).
  - Confirm expected **ESP32 current draw** and total subsystem power budget.
- Landen:
  - Confirm display’s operating voltage range and current draw from datasheet.

## 5. Component Sourcing & Vendor Constraints
- **Allowed vendors:**  
  - DigiKey  
  - Adafruit  
  - Amazon  
- **Not allowed:**  
  - Walmart  
  - eBay  
  - AliExpress  
- Adafruit identified as:
  - Valid source for **battery level indicators**, displays, and dev boards.
- Team will:
  - Continue sourcing **approved components** from the allowed vendor list.
  - Avoid references to non-approved suppliers in the final BOM.

**Action Item:**
- Brandon:
  - Identify suitable **battery level indicator** module from DigiKey/Adafruit/Amazon.
- Entire Team:
  - Ensure BOM items are only from approved vendors.

## 6. Display Enclosure & Mechanical Design
- Discussion on whether the display will be:
  - **Exposed**, or  
  - **Enclosed** to control light and glare.
- Tentative approach:
  - Use an **enclosed optical path** to the lens/head-up display area:
    - Reduce **ambient light** and glare.
    - Maintain consistent visibility outdoors.
- Mechanical constraints:
  - Must remain **comfortable** and **wearable** on the visor/eyewear.
  - May rely on **existing 3D CAD files** (from open-source designs) and adapt them.
- Key parameters:
  - **Brightness** and **contrast ratio** are critical for outdoor use.
  - A higher contrast ratio allows for lower brightness while retaining legibility.

**Action Items:**
- Bryce:
  - Search for existing **3D models/CAD files** for AR-style clip-on or visor mounts.
  - Begin planning enclosure around the chosen display size and mounting geometry.

---

## 7. Software / GitHub Reference (PyTrack Launch Monitor)
- Team identified an **open-source GitHub repository** (PyTrack / launch monitor) containing:
  - Camera calibration code.
  - LED control.
  - Core tracking algorithms.
- Plan:
  - **Download and archive** all relevant code and documentation.
  - Use as a **reference implementation** and adapt as needed for this project.
- Consensus:
  - Building the entire launch-monitor codebase **from scratch** would be impractical within the capstone timeline.

**Action Item:**
- Software lead:
  - Mirror/download the GitHub repository locally.
  - Identify which modules can be reused or adapted (e.g., camera calibration, detection pipeline).

---

## 8. Subsystem Coordination
- **Display Subsystem (Landen):**
  - Select final OLED or similar display.
  - Verify dimensions, brightness, voltage, and interface (SPI/I2C).
  - Coordinate with mechanical subsystem for enclosure sizing.
- **Power Subsystem (Brandon):**
  - Finalize LiPo capacity target (e.g., **~4000 mAh** as a baseline).
  - Design battery → converter → ESP32 + display power chain.
  - Confirm grounding scheme and protection/fusing at the battery.
- **Mechanical Subsystem (Bryce):**
  - Use available 3D files or create custom housing to:
    - Mount display.
    - Route wiring.
    - Ensure comfort and stability during swing.
- **Communications / Processing:**
  - Verify ESP32 and Raspberry Pi boards include **Bluetooth 5.0** or equivalent wireless capability.
  - Determine data flow: cameras → Raspberry Pi → microcontroller → visor/app.

## 9. Next Steps
1. **Meet with Matt** (Tuesday, 1:30 PM):
   - Present updated concept for coaching logic (per-round/per-nine vs per-shot).
   - Confirm expectations on:
     - Data collection.
     - UI complexity.
     - Level of precision required for coaching feedback.
2. **Display & UI:**
   - Landen to narrow down display candidates and confirm readability/space for metrics + short advice.
3. **Power & Battery:**
   - Brandon to lock in converter choice (boost/buck-boost) and validate battery runtime estimates.
4. **Mechanical Enclosure:**
   - Bryce to identify or adapt 3D models for the visor/glasses mount and begin enclosure concept.
5. **Shall Statements & Documentation:**
   - Team to update shall statements to:
     - Reflect realistic coaching frequency (per round/per nine).
     - Explicitly include **voltage, current, and runtime** requirements derived from new design decisions.
