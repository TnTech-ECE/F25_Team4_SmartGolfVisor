# Smart Golf Visor — Meeting Minutes (from “New Recording 16.m4a”)

## Purpose
Discuss display options, power subsystem needs, controller selection, and near-term deliverables for Detailed Design.

## Key Decisions & Agreements
- **Display is “just a display” (not a projector).**
- **Two candidate micro-displays under consideration:**
  - **0.49" panel:** requires multiple rails (≈1.8 V, +5.4 V, –5.4 V) and external power generation.
  - **0.39" panel:** needs only 5 V and 1.8 V; includes onboard PCB that handles conversions.
- **Controller:** leaning toward an **ESP32 (P4 dev board)** variant that already has **Bluetooth** (and possibly Wi-Fi), to avoid extra modules.
- **MIPI lane mismatch identified:** display expects **4-lane MIPI**, some ESP32 options provide **2-lane**. A **signal conversion/bridge** may be required.
- **Timeline:** team will produce a **timeline** and proceed toward **Detailed Design** (schematics, diagrams, BOM).

## Technical Discussion Summary
- **Power/Display Rails**
  - **0.49":** needs buck for 1.8 V, boost for +5.4 V, and inverting DC-DC for –5.4 V (AVDD).
  - **0.39":** integrated board simplifies power (5 V + 1.8 V).
- **Driver/Interface**
  - Displays available with **MIPI** interfaces; some versions include interface boards that still require correct power rails.
  - Consider **HDMI-to-MIPI** or other **bridge** solutions if lane count or protocol is incompatible.
- **Integration Approach**
  - Short-term: wire-up or small **carrier/adapter PCB** for reliable pinout and rails.
  - Long-term: evaluate **custom PCB** for cleaner integration; look for **existing Gerbers** as a starting point (KiCad import).
- **Compute Board**
  - ESP32 dev board with onboard **BT/Wi-Fi** is preferred to reduce parts and wiring.
- **Detailed Design Scope**
  - Move from conceptual to **schematics**, **interface diagrams**, **BOM**, and **analysis** demonstrating constraints are met.

## Dependencies & Inputs Needed
- **Exact component spec sheets** (display variant, ESP32 board, regulators/PMICs) so power draw (mW) can be totaled accurately.
- **Confirmation of final display choice** (0.39" vs 0.49") to lock power architecture.
- **Decision on MIPI bridging strategy** (2-lane → 4-lane conversion, or alternative interface).

## Action Items
1. **Power Lead (Landen):**
   - Compile **battery sizing** once all component **spec sheets** and power draws are confirmed.
   - Draft recommended **power tree** for the chosen display (rails, converters, protections).
2. **Display/Hardware Lead:**
   - **Confirm the display module** (0.39" vs 0.49") and whether it ships with an interface/power board.
   - Investigate **MIPI lane conversion** or alternative bridge (e.g., HDMI-to-MIPI), and document options.
   - Search for **reference Gerber files** for a minimal carrier to simplify wiring; share with the team.
3. **Compute/Embedded Lead:**
   - Validate **ESP32 dev board** capabilities (BT/Wi-Fi, MIPI compatibility, available I/O).
   - Document the **interface plan** from ESP32 → display (protocol, lanes, bridges).
4. **All:**
   - Provide **spec sheets/links** for assigned components in a shared folder for power budgeting.
   - Draft the **project timeline** with milestones to Detailed Design sign-off.

## Risks & Open Questions
- **Interface risk:** 2-lane ESP32 vs 4-lane display; feasibility, cost, and latency of bridges.
- **Power complexity:** If the 0.49" is chosen, added rails increase design complexity, PCB effort, and potential noise sources.
- **Schedule dependency:** Awaiting **advisor feedback**; turnaround may affect Detailed Design pacing.

## Next Steps
- Finalize **display selection** and **bridge strategy**.
- Complete **spec sheet collection** → **power budget** → **battery capacity recommendation**.
- Produce **schematics**, **block/interface diagrams**, and **BOM** for Detailed Design draft.
