_All content derived from team transcript_  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Meeting Purpose:**  
Plan structure, slide assignments, and content for the Capstone presentation.

---

## **1. Grading & Evaluation Discussion**
- Confirmed point values for IDA evaluation and Controls final.
- Members discussed submitting screenshots/confirmations to the appropriate Dropbox.

---

## **2. Technical Difficulties**
- Multiple issues opening PowerPoints due to slow Wi-Fi.
- RISD PowerPoints noted as especially large and difficult to load on some devices.

---

## **3. Stakeholders Identification**
- Identified stakeholders:
  - Golfers
  - Individuals who enjoy golf
  - Users seeking affordable, performance-improvement tools

---

## **4. Presentation Planning**

### **Slide Count & Time Constraints**
- Presentation is limited to **10 minutes**.
- Team currently has **10–12 slides** → not feasible without heavy condensation.
- Estimated time: ~45 seconds per slide, ~1–1.5 minutes per speaker.

### **Agreed-Upon Approach**
- **Conceptual Design**
  - Keep to 1–2 slides maximum.
  - Include:
    - Hardware block diagram  
    - Software flowchart(s)
  - Maintain only high-level explanations.

- **Detailed Design**
  - Present as a **subsystem overview**.
  - Each team member summarizes their subsystem in **20–30 seconds**.
  - Include graphics (visor CAD, PCB preview, tower, etc.) as space allows.

- **Background**
  - Quick introduction before transitioning into conceptual content.

- **Contributions & Acknowledgements**
  - Contributions slide should reflect **project work**, not slide clicking order.
  - Acknowledgements slide required (e.g., advisors, external contributors).

---

## **5. Standards, Ethics, and Broader Impacts**
- Section must mention:
  - Standards used/considered  
  - Ethical considerations  
  - Broader impact for users/public
- Team agreed:
  - **Very short section (~30 seconds)**  
  - Only list standards; no deep technical detail required.

---

## **6. Conceptual Design Clarifications**
- Required elements:
  - Hardware block diagrams
  - Software/app workflow diagrams
  - High-level operational/user flow
- Team discussed whether the conceptual flow should include user steps;  
  decision: **include a simplified use-case flow**.

---

## **7. Detailed Design Clarifications**
- Present only selective highlights:
  - Visor hardware structure
  - Battery specification overview
  - Brief PCB specification reference
  - CAD model preview
  - Software subsystem highlights
- Excessive detail removed due to time constraints.

---

## **8. Formatting & Slide Cleanup**
- Items needing correction:
  - Template background inconsistencies
  - Name spelling verification
  - Style alignment across slides
  - Resume uploads for portfolio portion

---

## **9. Materials & Fabrication Notes**
- PETG replaced with more durable outdoor-rated filament.
- Plan to experiment with thread sizes and hole adjustments in visor prototypes.
- Consider showing tower model or PCB visuals if time permits.

---

## **10. Next Steps / Action Items**
- Finalize slide assignments.
- Condense conceptual design to **1–2 slides**.
- Prepare **brief subsystem summaries** for detailed design.
- Add and finalize **acknowledgements** slide.
- Verify conceptual flowcharts align with hardware/software.
- Fix formatting issues (scaling, background, alignment).
- Ensure all members update their slide sections before next meeting.
