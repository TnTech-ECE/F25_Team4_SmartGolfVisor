# **Meeting Minutes — New Recording 24**

**Date:** Not specified  
**Attendees:** Multiple team members  
**Purpose:** Discuss formatting expectations for Detailed Design documents, Bill of Materials structure, PCB considerations, workload planning, and scheduling for the upcoming presentation.

---

## **1. Specifications & Constraints Formatting**

- JC provided feedback on formatting requirements for the Detailed Design.  
- **Specifications** must be written as **bolded bullet-point shall statements**.  
- **Constraints** must appear in a **table** containing:  
  - Constraint  
  - Rationale  
- Team agreed this format satisfies project requirements and should be used consistently.  
- A screenshot/example will be shared in Microsoft Teams for reference.

---

## **2. Bill of Materials (BOM) Formatting**

- Current BOM formats across subsystems are inconsistent.  
- A team member created an **Excel BOM template** that includes:  
  - Component  
  - Manufacturer  
  - Part Number  
  - Distributor  
  - Description  
  - Quantity  
  - Cost  
- Team agreed to adopt this template.  
- Notes:  
  - JLCPCB parts lists will rely on JLC-specific part numbers.  
  - For JLC-sourced BOM sections, include a note such as:  
    *“All components in this section are sourced from JLCPCB.”*  
- Some subsystems require **two BOMs**:  
  - PCB components (JLCPCB)  
  - Off-board components (wire, switch, fuse holder, etc.)

## **3. PCB & Mechanical Constraints**

- Discussion of PCB size: earlier guidance referenced **4 × 4 inches**, though final dimensions may be reduced over winter break.  
- Enclosure design considerations:  
  - Possible placement of the battery compartment on the lid.  
  - A cable pass-through hole will allow routing power to the board.  
  - Final switch placement depends on the completed PCB layout.  
- Team members will provide **3D PCB models** for accurate enclosure integration.

## **4. Timeline & Submission Planning**

- JC stated the submission may be turned in **early Thursday morning** before grading begins.  
- Most members plan to submit between **Wednesday night and early Thursday morning**.  
- Team members discussed prioritizing this submission over other coursework.

---

## **5. Presentation Planning**

- Presentation work begins **after the Detailed Design submission**.  
- Proposed schedule:  
  - **Wednesday:** Short planning meeting  
  - **Friday/weekend:** Begin slide creation  
- Presentation slides will be **individualized by subsystem** but merged into a single deck.  
- The conclusion cannot be written until all subsystem work is complete.

---

## **6. Additional Notes**

- Members discussed availability around exams and work schedules.  
- Consistency is needed in:  
  - Physical deliverables  
  - Formatting  
  - GitHub updates  
  - PCB models for enclosure design
