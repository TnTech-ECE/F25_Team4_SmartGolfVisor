2. Discussion Summary

2.1 Overview of Project Subsystems

Brandon led the meeting by presenting the main functional areas of the Smart Golf Visor.
The group reviewed the proposed subsystems:
	•	Data Acquisition and Interface
	•	Visor Powering System
	•	Visor Design
	•	Communications
	•	HUD Display
	•	App/Software

The goal was to ensure clear ownership and accountability for each subsystem while maintaining cross-team collaboration for integration and testing.

2.2 Interest-Based Role Assignment

Each team member was asked about their interests and preferred technical focus area. Subsystem ownership was then assigned based on both interest and technical background to promote balanced workload and engagement.

Andrew Goostree — Data Acquisition and Interface
	•	Develop the system to acquire data from the launch monitor’s API
	•	Implement processes for retrieving accurate real-time shot data
	•	Store previous shot data for later analysis and review
	•	Generate automated coaching suggestions based on acquired data

Landen Johnson — Visor Powering System
	•	Select an appropriate battery to power the visor system
	•	Design and develop a rechargeable battery circuit
	•	Implement a Battery Management System (BMS) for safe and efficient power regulation

Bryce Hughes — Visor Design
	•	Design the physical structure and layout of the visor
	•	Identify and integrate the correct lens for the display system
	•	Determine placement of all components (OLED display, microcontroller, battery, BMS, etc.)

Ryan Zerkovich — Communications
	•	Develop communication protocol from the launch monitor to the app/software
	•	Establish the communication link from the app/software to the microcontroller
	•	Write and implement microcontroller firmware for data processing and communication

Brandon Zerkovich — HUD Display
	•	Design and implement the heads-up display (HUD) for the visor
	•	Display real-time shot metrics, coaching feedback, and ball trajectory direction

Michael Madigan — App/Software
	•	Design and develop the companion app/software interface for the system
	•	Create an intuitive user experience for viewing performance metrics and coaching insights
	•	Integrate connectivity between the launch monitor, visor, and stored shot data
	•	Include functionality for session tracking, history review, and personalized feedback

4. Integration Planning

Emphasized the need for subsystem integration testing once initial prototypes are complete.
Cross-team checkpoints will be established to ensure smooth data flow and communication between the visor hardware, display, and app.

⸻

5. Next Meeting
	•	Topic: Review subsystem progress and discuss hardware/software interfacing
	•	Tentative Date: 10-9
	•	Action: Each member will present an initial design draft or concept for their subsystem
