Capstone Meeting Minutes (Quick Summary)


Time/Location: Engineering Building, Study Room 301 — ~2:51 PM

Purpose: Team check-in on current project progress + next steps


Individual Progress Updates



Michael (Software / Bluetooth)


Officially began coding
Testing Bluetooth modules communicating via Python
Research indicates web-hosted / remote setup should work, but could be tricky
Estimates about 1 month to get base system set up, with debugging taking longer
Not currently blocked but may request help later


Chad

Has been very helpful to the team (noted in discussion)


(You / Landen) – PCB / Power


PCB is basically done
Concern: one MOSFET footprint causes clearance errors no matter routing/trace width
Belief: issue may be due to JLCPCB design rule capability limits
Possible fix: swap MOSFET to a different part/footprint
Waiting for JC video feedback, but errors may not matter functionally
Need to redo/clean detailed design after review (add real PCB photos, remove placeholder text)

Power system change:

5V system removed
Battery is 3.7V LiPo
Current battery roughly 4000 mAh (large physical size ~90mm x 45mm)
Possible to reduce to 2000–3000 mAh for smaller size
Downsizing battery does not affect circuit, only runtime

Brian

Has display code written
Only remaining coding work: IMU sensor (expected to be easy)
Offered help to Michael as needed

Andrew (Enclosure / PCB)

Watching reference videos for guidance
Needs to finish PCB, plans to work with Brian
Components mostly selected
Working on enclosure/base box layout depending on battery size/shape
Needs to select a better battery (old one failing) and keep price low

Ryan (Board / Enclosure)

Board is mostly done
Considering adding indicator LEDs (on/off, transmit lines) mainly for testing
Learned battery board already has 4 battery-level indicator diodes
Enclosure will include cutouts for:
USB-C port
battery indicator LEDs

Halfway done designing enclosure (including Landen’s parts)
Needs display cutout and display arm considerations


Parts Ordering / Admin Notes

There is an Excel ordering sheet for purchasing parts
Landen already started it and will share with everyone
Each member should fill in their own section with product links
Team discovered a full parts list / build guide posted online (step-by-step), very helpful


Key Decisions / Action Items


✅ Remove 5V system (confirmed)

✅ Battery can possibly be downsized later

🔧 Landen: fix MOSFET clearance problem (possibly change part)

📄 Clean up detailed design doc after review

📦 Everyone fill in parts ordering Excel sheet

🖨️ Enclosure: plan USB-C + LED indicator cutouts; 3D print with filament (already budgeted)
